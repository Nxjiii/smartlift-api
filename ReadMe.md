# 💪 SmartLift — AI Gym Split Generator (MVP)

🚧 MVP in Progress — July–August 2025 🚧

SmartLift is an AI-powered workout split planner that helps gym-goers avoid muscle group clashes and optimize their weekly routines — no guesswork, just smart splits.

Built solo and fast — delivering value in weeks, not months.

## Problem

Most gym apps either:

Offer generic non-personalised routines

Overwhelm with complex tracking and options

Fail to prevent poor planning

SmartLift solves this by generating tailored weekly splits based on:

Your goals (hypertrophy, strength, fat loss)

Available days

Muscle recovery time

Equipment access

## Current Status

Started CI/CD and backend setup on July 14, 2025

MVP target launch by August 31, 2025

## MVP Scope (Deadline: August 31, 2025)
Simple onboarding (goals, days/week, equipment)

Core smart split generation logic

Editable workouts (swap exercises)

Export to PDF/share

Stripe payments integration

Live landing page with waitlist

Beta testing with 5–10 users for feedback
